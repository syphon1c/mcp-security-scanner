## [1.0.0-beta] - 2025-09-15

### üéâ First Public Beta Release

This marks the first public beta release of MCP Security Scanner, a security assessment tool for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The project combines static analysis, dynamic vulnerability testing, and real-time proxy monitoring to protect enterprise MCP deployments.

### ‚ú® Features Added

#### Core Scanner Engine
- **Local Scanning**: Static analysis of MCP server source code for vulnerability detection
- **Remote Scanning**: Dynamic testing of live MCP servers for security vulnerabilities
- **Multi-language Support**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Command injection, SQL injection, path traversal, template injection
- **Risk Assessment**: Quantified risk scoring system (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

#### Live Monitoring Proxy
- **Real-time Traffic Interception**: Transparent monitoring between MCP clients and servers  
- **Threat Detection**: Automatic pattern matching and blocking of malicious activities
- **Protocol Support**: Both HTTP and WebSocket transport layers
- **Zero Configuration**: No client-side changes required for deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: Request/response timing and throughput metrics

#### Security Policy Engine  
- **Policy-based Rules**: JSON-based rule engine with configurable detection patterns
- **Pre-built Policies**: 
  - `critical-security.json`: High-risk vulnerabilities and critical security issues
  - `standard-security.json`: General security checks and best practices  
  - `mcp-advanced-security.json`: Advanced MCP-specific threats with 159+ detection rules
  - `advanced-polymorphic-security.json`: Advanced pattern matching capabilities
- **Custom Policies**: Template and examples for organisation-specific security rules

#### Reporting System
- **Multiple Formats**: JSON, HTML, PDF, and Text output formats
- **Automated Directory Creation**: Reports save to `./reports/` by default
- **Timestamp Format**: `mcp_security_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext`
- **Batch Generation**: `--all-formats` flag for simultaneous multi-format output
- **Custom Output**: Configurable output directories and file names

#### Enterprise Integration
- **SIEM Integration**: JSON alert forwarding to security information and event management systems
- **SOAR Integration**: Incident creation via security orchestration platforms
- **Slack Notifications**: Webhook-based alerting for real-time monitoring
- **RESTful API**: Monitoring endpoints for proxy health and security alerts

#### Configuration Management
- **YAML Configuration**: Structured configuration files with environment variable support
- **Default Settings**: Sensible defaults for immediate deployment
- **Environment Variables**: Support for sensitive data injection (API keys, webhooks)
- **Runtime Configuration**: Dynamic policy loading and security rule updates

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Architecture Components
- **MCPScanner**: Core scanning engine with static and dynamic analysis
- **MCPProxy**: Real-time traffic interception and threat detection
- **Policy Engine**: JSON-based rule matching with regex pattern support
- **MCP Protocol Handler**: Native MCP message parsing and tool/resource analysis

#### Performance Features
- **Concurrent Processing**: Multi-threaded scanning for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large codebases and traffic volumes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and logging throughout the application
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks

### üìö Documentation
- Complete user manual with usage examples
- Configuration management guide  
- Proxy documentation with deployment instructions
- Advanced traffic analysis techniques
- Installation guide for various environments
- Policy creation examples and templates
- Testing guide with mock server examples
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues

### üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit test coverage for core components
- Integration testing with mock MCP servers
- Performance benchmarking suite
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Code quality checks with golangci-lint
- Security-focused development practices

### üîí Security Features
- **Pattern Detection**: Advanced regex-based threat identification
- **Real-time Blocking**: Automatic blocking of detected malicious patterns
- **Alert Generation**: Structured security alerts with evidence and context
- **Traffic Analysis**: Deep inspection of MCP protocol messages
- **Risk Scoring**: Quantitative risk assessment for detected vulnerabilities

### üì¶ Deployment
- **Single Binary**: Self-contained executable with no external dependencies
- **Docker Support**: Containerised deployment options
- **Cross-platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Minimal Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
- Static analysis cannot detect all vulnerability types (e.g. semantic issues like prompt injection)
- Performance may vary with very large codebases or high-traffic environments
- Some advanced MCP protocol features may not be fully covered in initial release
- Beta software - use with appropriate testing in your environments or dev endpoints

### üìà Metrics
- 159+ detection rules in advanced security policy
- Support for 7 programming languages
- 4 output report formats
- 3 enterprise integration types (SIEM, SOAR, Slack)
- Full MCP protocol version "2024-11-05" compatibility

### ü§ù Contributors
Initial development with AI assistance for enhanced development efficiency while maintaining code quality and security standards and of course, Unit Tests...because no-one loves doing Unit Tests.
